  - "\u201CWho the heck even steals tires?\u201D"
  - "\u201CI mean, you have to undo all those screws...and then you have to jack
    up the car...\u201D"
  - "\u201CNot to mention those things are heavy...I mean, what kind of a person...\u201D"
  - He really, really hates changing tires.
  - "\u201C...and they didn\u2019t even leave the screws behind! You\u2019d have
    to be insane to...\u201D"
  - ...Yes. And after he realized his tires had been stolen, he had to find a different
    way to get to work.
  - "\u201C...those tires were supposed to last me another ten years! Do you know
    how expensive tires are?! In fact...\u201D"
  - "Ahem. You should change your tires every 3\u20135 years, actually. So, he found
    a different way to get to work."
  - "\u201C...and I just know the insurance company is going to insist that this
    is a matter of personal liability and blah blah blah\u2014\u201D"
  - AHEM! He got an Uber to work! Moving on!
